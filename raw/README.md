It is suggested you uncompress here Ofcom's broadband coverage data available from data.gov.uk [here](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/broadband-coverage). This will likely create a folder named 'ofcom-uk-fixed-broadband-postcode-level-data-2013'. All scripts in this project are written to reference that by default. Testing was done with a version of that data downloaded on 1st December 2013.
