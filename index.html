<h2>About</h2>

<p>Ofcom has published on 16 October 2013 as open data a postcode-level review of UK broadband coverage, available on the <a target="_" href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/broadband-coverage">data.gov.uk</a> website and licensed under the Open Government Licence. The data includes information on the kind of connections being available (old stile <2Mbps, modern or 'superfast'), their number and the recorded speed.</p>

<p>As described in the Ofcom documentation accompanying the original files, the data was provided by the largest fixed broadband providers in the UK for the period of <b>June to July 2013</b>. Please note that - in Ofcom's wording - <i>due to variations in broadband performance over time, the [data] should not be regarded as a defintive and fixed view of the UK's fixed broadband infrastructure (...) [and] be viewed in conjunction with the <a target=_ href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/broadband-speeds/broadband-speeds-may2013/">Infrastructure Report</a> published by Ofcom</i>.</p>

<p>Starting from that data, this webpage is a very humble broadband checker. The original data is stored in two .csv files totalling >66Mb that are a bit of a challenge to open and browse. This little website makes the same information accessible for postcode queries. The source and the processed data derived from Ofcom's original are available on <a target="_" href="https://github.com/giacecco/ukbroadband">GitHub</a>.

<p>Column headers are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Postcode.No.Spaces (was "Postcode.No.Spaces." in Ofcom's original dataset) - Does what it says on the tin</p>

<li><p>Postcode.Data.Status - This field contains one of five options.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>No premises - There are no residential or small business delivery points in the postcode as listed from the 2012 file held by europa. There may be large business premises and new built connections in these postcodes more recently than our premises count focuses upon.
		<li>Insufficient Premises -  This status means there are less than three residential or small business premises in the postcode. To protect anonymity broadband data has not been provided for these postcodes.
		<li>Insufficient Data - This status means that we hold data on less than three broadband connections in the postcode. To protect anonymity broadband data has not been provided for these postcodes. 
		<li>No data - We do not hold data on broadband connections in the postcode. This may be because consumers in the postcode have chosen not to subscribe to broadband, or that information was not included in the data provided by the largest ISPs, or that broadband is not available in the postcode.
		<li>OK - This means that there are at least three residential or small business premises and that we hold data on at least three broadband connections in the postcode, only the amount of connections is this case.
	</ol>
	<p>When applying the different status values the order of precedence (highest to lowest) is as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>No premises
		<li>No data
		<li>Insufficient Premises
		<li>Insufficient Data
		<li>OK
	</ul>

<li><p>Information on average sync speed, mean sync speed and sub 2Mbit/s connections is only provided for postcodes with a status of 'OK'</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Lines.Less.Than.2Mbps.T.F (was "Lines...2Mbps.Y.N." in Ofcom's original dataset) - A 'TRUE' indicates whether there are one or more broadband connections with a modem sync speed less than 2.2Mbit/s (for fibre and copper connections) or 2.0 Mbit/s for cable customers. A 'FALSE' indicates there are no lines operating at below 2Mbit/s. 
		<li>Average.Speed.Mbps - This field takes the values of mean modem sync speed of connections in the postcode to 1 decimal place.  If over or equal to 30 Mbit/s, 30 is shown.
		<li>Median.Speed.Mbps - This field picks out the middle modem sync speed in each postcode as if they were all ordered from smallest to highest and the middle one is selected (or average of middle two values if there is an even number of values). If over or equal to 30 Mbit/s, 30 is shown.
		<li>Maximum.Speed.Mbps - This field calculates the highest modem speed in each postcode in Mbit/s. Differently than in the Ofcom original dataset, if over or equal to 30 Mbit/s, 30 is shown.
	</ul>

<li><p>Superfast.Broadband.Available.T.F (was "NGA.Available.Y.N." in Ofcom's original dataset) - This field indicates whether Virgin Media or Openreach are able to provide superfast broadband services to one or more premises in the postcode. Note, not all premises will necessarily be able to order the service and, for fibre to the cabinet technologies, not all connections will necessarily be able to achieve superfast speeds.</p>

<li>Number.of.Connections - This field lists the amount of active broadband connections within the postcode.  The amount of connections are listed regardless of there being insufficient data to publish any further values. Differently than in the Ofcom original dataset, where less than three connections are recorded but the exact number is unknown, 1 is shown. 

</ul>
